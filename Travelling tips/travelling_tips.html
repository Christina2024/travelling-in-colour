        <ol>
          <li><h3>Travel Local </h3>
            If you are new to traveling alone as a woman, I recommend starting out small first!   
            This looks like taking yourself out to eat alone, visiting surrounding domestic cities by yourself, 
            and traveling to different states alone. I used to do this all the time before making my first international 
            solo trip, and it allowed me to build up confidence in navigating the world alone.</li>
            
             <li><h3>Do Your Research </h3>
              You can never be too prepared when traveling alone. Be sure to conduct thorough research
               about the places you visit. This includes crime rates, weather, other solo travel experiences 
               from the area, what to do, nightlife, and basically everything you can think of. 
               I recommend watching YouTube videos to get an authentic feel for a destination you will be seeing or 
               want to see in the future.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Talk to Strangers - Just Don't Overshare </h3>
             
              Many other countries are much safer and friendlier than the United States. 
              Always be aware of your surroundings, but remember that not every stranger you 
              meet is trying to kidnap you. Never give away too much information. Use your 
              own judgment when talking to strangers and decide what is best to give away. For 
              instance, I will hardly let someone know I am traveling alone. 
              I typically say I will meet someone, so they know people expect me. If they ask 
              where you are staying, never give the name of the hotel. And my number one rule is 
              to never update your social media in real-time.
              On the bright side, you can get the best details and scoops when talking to strangers! 
              They will provide the best recommendations for food, restaurants, activities, and more!</li>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Download Offline Maps </h3>
            
            It is essential to download offline maps when traveling solo because offline maps will direct you to your 
            destination, even if your internet connection is sluggish or nonexistent. 
            Anytime I am traveling internationally or in an area with limited internet access, such as the outdoors 
            for hiking, I download multiple map options before I leave. You won't need to spend extra money on data roaming 
            fees, and all of the map's details are already stored on your device, so you do not have to wait for the map to load when you search for a place or need directions.</li>
        </ol> 
      </main>
        <p>All in all, solo travel as a black woman is a fantastic journey everyone should experience.
          When you're prepared and ready to step out of your comfort zone, you'll be surprised at all of the 
          memories you make!
